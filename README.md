# Data-Structures in Python
This repository contains Python implementations of common data structures, designed for learning, practice, and as a reference for algorithmic problem-solving.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- [Singly Linked List](SinglyLinkedList/README.md)
- [Doubly Linked List](DoublyLinkedList/README.md)
- [Stacks](Stacks/README.md)
- [Queues](Queues/README.md)
- [Trees](Trees/README.md)
- [Graphs](Graphs/README.md)

## ðŸ“š Features
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Each data structure is implemented in its own module.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each folder contains a `README.md` explaining the data structure, its use cases, and how to use the implementation.
- **Extensibility**: The repository is structured to accommodate additional data structures.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Structures.git
   cd Data-Structures
2. Navigate to the folder of the data structure you want to explore.
3. Run the Python scripts to test or explore the implementation.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Familiarity with basic Python syntax.

#  Future Additions
1. Doubly Linked Lists
2. Circular Linked Lists
3. Priority Queues
4. Hash Tables
5. AVL Trees
6. More graph algorithms
